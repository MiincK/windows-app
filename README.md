The window will snap to the edges of your screen, and you can mouse scroll on the window to increase/decrease the volume. You can also set it to be topmost in settings.

# Instructions

## Installation
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/MiincK/windows-app/releases) and run it.
Official latest release is [here](https://github.com/LISTEN-moe/windows-app/releases).

## Updates
Auto-updates are baked into the app (updates are checked on startup only though), which will check for updates, download the latest version and restart the app automatically for you if you click OK. It backs up your older version to `ListenMoe.bak` in the same folder.

## Other notes
If you find yourself unable to see the window (for example if you disconnect a monitor, or change your monitor resolutions), you can just right click tray icon and select `Reset Location`.

# Todo
 - Code cleanup (let's face it, this will never happen)
 - Taskbar media player controls, global media hotkey hooks
